# Data Parser

Feel free to use this code however you would like.  The defined functions will read large CSV files from a folder called csvData and will extract all matching phone numbers and write them to a new CSV file called results.

This was a project I developed to help a friend with viral marketing for his company.

Happy Coding.

# Next Steps
